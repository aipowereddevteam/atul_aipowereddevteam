# Real-Time AI Diagnostics

**Role:** Full Stack Engineer | **Tech Stack:** GraphQL, AWS CloudFront, WebRTC

## The Challenge
Medical professionals needed instant access to high-resolution diagnostic images and video feeds. High latency in the legacy system was causing delays in critical diagnoses (Aident/GetScreened).

## The Solution
Engineered a **Edge-Computed Diagnostic Platform** focusing on extreme performance and low latency.

### Key Innovations
- **GraphQL Federation**: Unified disparate data sources into a single, efficient API graph, reducing over-fetching.
- **AWS CloudFront & S3 Optimization**: Deployed a global CDN strategy to cache heavy medical imagery at the edge.
- **WebRTC Video Streaming**: Implemented secure, low-latency peer-to-peer video streaming for remote consultations.

## Impact
- **70% Faster Load Times**: Drastically reduced the time-to-interactive for high-res medical images.
- **Remote Accessibility**: Enabled seamless remote diagnostics even in low-bandwidth environments.
