# Computer Vision Safety Grid

**Role:** Frontend Architect | **Tech Stack:** HTML5 Canvas, WebSockets, React

## The Challenge
Industrial safety monitoring required visualizing multiple live video feeds and overlaying AI-detected hazard bounding boxes in real-time without browser lag.

## The Solution
Built a **High-Performance Safety Dashboard** capable of rendering complex visual data at 60fps.

### Key Innovations
- **Live Canvas API Rendering**: Bypassed standard DOM manipulation for rendering thousands of dynamic bounding boxes directly on the GPU-accelerated Canvas.
- **WebSockets**: Established persistent, bi-directional connections for millisecond-latency alert delivery.
- **Low-Latency Streaming**: Optimized video stream buffering for near-real-time synchronization with AI inference data.

## Impact
- **Zero-Lag Visualization**: Achieved smooth 60fps rendering of multi-feed hazard detection.
- **Enhanced Safety**: Provided operators with instantaneous visual feedback on potential safety violations.
