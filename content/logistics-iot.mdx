# Hyper-Scale Logistics Engine

**Role:** Systems Architect | **Tech Stack:** Redis, MongoDB, AWS IoT

## The Challenge
Processing **20,000+ monthly export/import records** with real-time tracking requirements created a massive bottleneck. Legacy systems couldn't handle the throughput, leading to data staleness and operational delays.

## The Solution
Architected a **Real-Time IoT Tracking System** (AlVision EXIM) that revolutionized the logistics pipeline.

### Key Innovations
- **Redis Caching Layer**: Implemented a high-performance caching strategy that resulted in a **60% speedup** in data retrieval.
- **MongoDB Change Streams**: Built a reactive data pipeline to push real-time updates to the frontend without polling.
- **Excel-to-JSON Pipelines**: Automated the ingestion of massive legacy datasets, reducing manual entry errors by 99%.

## Impact
- **Real-Time Visibility**: Enabled sub-second tracking for thousands of concurrent shipments.
- **Scalability**: System successfully handled a 300% spike in data volume during peak seasons without degradation.
